0.02 2013-09-05
  - PUBLIC RELEASE
  - Enough smoke tests have trickled in that I'm comfortable with portability
    from Perl 5.8.9 through present.  Would like to see more Windows tests, but
    unofficial reports are that we build and test alright there as well.
  - Bump version number to 0.02 and release.
  - This version is compatible as a plugin for List::BinarySearch v0.12.

    context (Should be empty list.  Was a single element of undef).
